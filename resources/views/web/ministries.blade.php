                                    <p>Crazy!! That’s got to be the best word to describe the high school ministry of DBF Central. Two ministries join together to serve the age group of 12-17 – these ministries are On-Track and HeartsAblaze. They have everything going on here; mad, crazy and noisy games, times in music and worship, inspiring times of studying the bible and deep friendships all around.<br><br>They have an energetic and committed leadership team who develops amazing plans and programs that both enjoy the energy that comes with these ages and at the same time focus on deepening relationships – both vertically and horizontally.
